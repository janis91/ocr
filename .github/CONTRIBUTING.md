## Contributing to Source Code

Thanks for wanting to contribute source code to OCR. You are great!

Before I am able to merge your code into the OCR app, you need to agree to release your code under the AGPL license.

* It's required to add PHPUnit tests and/or TypeScript tests (Jest) to your pull requests in order to make sure your patches work as intended
* Don't use bleeding edge `core` features unless you have to, instead use the OCP interfaces.
 
We're looking forward to your contributions!
